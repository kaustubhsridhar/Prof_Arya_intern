Hello!

This repository consists all the code I used to 
1. map my sorroundings using Lidar V3 Lite
2. do image processing on my mapped sorroundings
3. apply kalman filter ( in 1D) to a LIDAR moving towards the wall ( giving me a set of distance values) and an IMU on it ( given me accelerations from which distances can be obtained by double integration)
4. MORE TO BE ADDED........
